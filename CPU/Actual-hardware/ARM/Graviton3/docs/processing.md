Upon completion of performance counter sampling we proceed to processing stage.

This pipeline consists of four stages:
- Raw data parsing and calculation of derived metrics (bandwidth and latency).
- Data filtering: Automatic and manual removal of outliers.
- Data post-processing: Calculating averages, smoothening the data.
- Data output: Visualizing via plots or saving as CSV or custom data formats.
