# Mess benchmark for CPU platforms

Mess benchmark can be used to characterize memory system performance of both actual systems and simulators. We use seperate directory as we use different methods to measure bandwidth and latency. 

- Actual hardware: We use hardware counters to measure bandwidth and pointer-chase to measure latetcy. 

- Simulator: We measure bandwidth and latency from simulation output trace.
