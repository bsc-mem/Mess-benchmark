# Mess benchmark for simulators

Mess can be used to characterize system simualtors. It includes execution-driven and trace-driven simulations:

- Execution-driven simulation: A CPU simulator is connected to a memory model/simulator to simualte the full system. 

- Trace-driven simulation: Previously generated memory accesss traces are fed into detailed cycle-accurate memory simulator.
