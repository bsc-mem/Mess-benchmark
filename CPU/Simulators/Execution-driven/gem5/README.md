# Mess benchmark

Benchmark experiments using the Mess framework to evaluate various memory models in gem5 will be available here. Currently, only the benchmark source code is provided. We are actively working on uploading the complete experiment scripts, the data points from the associated paper, and the final performance curves in the coming weeks.
