# Mess benchmark: trace-driven memory simulation  

We can use memory trace generated by CPU simulators and characterize cycle-accurate memory simulators to evaluate their accuracy. 


## Generate traces

The traces are generated by ZSim CPU simulator connected to a single-cycle memory model and run Mess benchmark. It generates access traces based on input trace structure of memory simulators.
