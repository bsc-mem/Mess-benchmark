# Mess benchmark: trace-driven DRAMsim3 simulation  

Below we show the structure of this directory and how to simulate and generate bandwidth--latency curves for DARMsim3. 


## Directory structure 

```

│   ├── dramsim3.json
│   ├── dramsim3.txt 
│   ├── dramsim3epoch.json 
│   ├── output_jobID.err 
│   ├── output_jobID.out

└── submit.batch 
```

- traceInput: This folder contains zip files related to input traces for running trace-based simulation. 
- main.py: python file to parse the simulation outputs inside measurements_** folders and generate result.csv output file. 
- result.csv: This file contails information for generating bandwidth--latency curves. 
 - runner.sh: The main script that run the workflow. It execute the full workflow from reading the config file to generating final simulaiton results. 
- submit.batch: this is SLRUM job description. This is the template that will be copied to measurement_** folder by runner.sh to submit the simulation.

- measurement_rdRatio_Pause: it contains final simulation reuslts for a single point in bandwidth--latency curves.
	1. dramsim3.json,dramsim3.txt,dramsim3epoch: dramsim3 simulation outputs. 
	2. output_jobID.err/out: SLRUM error and output file. These files are used for debugging purposes. 
	3. submit.bash: SLRUM submis file to run the simulation on a node in MareNostrum 5  


## how to simulate Mess benchmark with dramsim3 

1. unzip the trace files inside traceInput folder. These trace files has been truncated. also currently only trace files for 100% and 0% read workload is available. This is due to capacity issue of git repositories. 

2. modify the submit.batch file to point to dramsim3 binary and correct config file. The dramsim3 version and config gile used in this study is added to the DRAMsim3 folder. 





## Generate traces

The traces are generated by ZSim CPU simulator connected to a single-cycle memory model and run Mess benchmark. It generates access traces based on input trace structure of memory simulators.
